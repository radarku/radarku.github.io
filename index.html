             Mr. Usbeck has worked on the Marti system as a software developer
             since 2010. Under the MIMIR program, Mr. Usbeck improved the
             existing Marti implementation (e.g., increasing throughput by two
             orders of magnitude) and developed new features for Marti
             including a firewall-penetrating protocol extension, an improved
             workflow for annotating images via a web interface, and a
             file-sharing utility. Under the Force Protection program, Mr.
             Usbeck implemented several features for an Android Tactical
             Assault Kit (ATAK), an Android-based situation-awareness
             application. Modifications that Mr. Usbeck has made to ATAK and
             Marti have made significant performance improvements, and he has
             designed and performed experiments to demonstrate these
             improvements. Mr. Usbeck also supports related off-site
             integration and testing exercises.
          </p>
          <p>
          Mr. Usbeck is also involved in procuring new business for BBN, and
          has been a contributor on several successful business development
          efforts including N-CET, SAFIM ECP, RIPR, and OpenPod. Additionally,
          Usbeck co-organizes the <i>Engineered Self-Organization</i>
          seminar series at BBN and has served on the program committee for
          numerous journals and conferences.
